# Corem Browser

## Description

This project implements a visualization of the GRE counts for a gene
contained in a specific corem.

For a gene, there are a number of corems that it can be contained in
and depending on the corems, the GRE counts can differ.

This browser will display the GRE counts depending on the selected
corem and centers itself around the area of the specified gene.
